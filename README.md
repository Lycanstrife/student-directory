<b>WHAT WE ARE BUILDING -</b>

In the first week we'll build a very simple Ruby script that will let us maintain a list of current students at Makers Academy. It will have the following features:

<hr />

1 - Show the list of all students

2 - ordered by name

3 - grouped by cohort (as an exercise)

4 - Add new students by asking the user to input the names

<hr />

<b>In week 2 we'll expand on it to do the following:</b>

<hr />

5 - Show information about a given student

6 - Add information related to a particular student (e.g. hobbies)

7 - Interactive menu to ask the user what he or she would like to do

8 - Displaying aggregate info (statistics)

9 - Saving this data to a file

10 - Loading it from the file

<hr />

The script will be invoked from the command-line and it will only use pure Ruby, that is, there will be no external libraries to use. It will have text-based interface that will not look particularly exciting but it's really important to understand how to build basic things before trying to create sophisticated websites.
